# Anthony decribed a part of its subscription system that does the pricing

# that must be satisfied in order to get, or not, a prefered pricing.
#
# Constraints are:
# 1. on the hours (ie: from 10am to 8pm),
# 2. on the days (ie: `mon`, `tue`, ..., `sat`, and/or `sun`),
# 3. on the frequency (ie: up to 4 hours per week)
# 4. on the spreading (ie: can, or cannot, split its quota of hours), and
# 5. on the location (ie: only certain studio).

# A `Plan` holds the constraints details but before going there, we need to
# represent the various values being part of the constraints.

# doesn't apply.
#
# Instead of considering all our constraints at once. We can organize them in a

# We don't need `Location` anymore. We introduced it to delegate some work to
# them. Those abstraction could be useful but could create a false sense of
# abstraction and attract other usages. The more usages there is, the harder it
# will be to update it. The definition of one method could sightly differ from
# one user to another, forcing us to introduce close and confusing naming or
# complex parameters to change the meaning of a method. All that, depending on
# the context.

# In the example, even `#covered_hours` was taken out of the `Period` class as
# its behavior is a bit too specific to our `HourOfDayRule`. Same for the
# `Studio#match?` method.

# Sadly we already have a bit of duplication around `#recent_hours`. Having this
# shared between rules wouldn't be a problem. A mixin could do that, but you
# would have to do that explicitly.

#
# From this representation of the plans, we could persist a given plan in a
# serialized way. Having a schema-less representation for constraints is a bit
# scary but opens things up on the versioning side...

# The Plan's serialization will hold references to classes, such as
# `DayOfWeekRule`. It means that it is possible to version not only the
# `allowed_days` but also the class that will manipulate it. We can have
# `DayOfWeekRule::V1` and `DayOfWeekRule::V2` or we can make `DayOfWeekRule`
# support more arguments...

# Using `Marshal` here is a dangerous choice:
# * it make querying the details of a `Plan` difficult,
# * it forces the _rules_ to be marshal-able (which isn't that bad), and
# * it could have security implications.
#
# I did it for showing an example of persistence but other approaches could
# be better. On the top of my head, I'm thinking about a more explicit
# serialization of the rules and their configurations.

# Anthony decribed a part of its subscription system that does the pricing
# for its self-service music studio business. They have a set of constraints
# that must be satisfied in order to get, or not, a prefered pricing.
#
# Constraints are:
# 1. on the hours (ie: from 10am to 8pm),
# 2. on the days (ie: `mon`, `tue`, ..., `sat`, and/or `sun`),
# 3. on the frequency (ie: up to 4 hours per week)
# 4. on the spreading (ie: can, or cannot, split its quota of hours), and
# 5. on the location (ie: only certain studio).

# A `Plan` holds the constraints details but before going there, we need to
# represent the various values being part of the constraints.

DAYS = %i[sun mon tue wed thu fri sat]

DAY_HOURS = (0..23).to_a

SPREADINGS = %i[consecutive split]

PERIODICITIES = %i[daily weekly monthly]

Frequency = Struct.new(:amount_of_hours, :periodicity, keyword_init: true)

# The constraint on the location imply constraints on the studio. A `Studio` has
# an unique identifier, a type, and a place. Each attribute will be a `String`.

Studio = Struct.new(:id, :type, :place, keyword_init: true)

# This helps defining the scope required for the location constraint.

SCOPES = %i[id type place]

Location = Struct.new(:scope, :reference, keyword_init: true)

# With those values, we can envision a `Plan` class, holding the logic telling
# if a prefered pricing must apply.

Plan = Struct.new(:days, :hours, :frequency, :spreading, :scope, keyword_init: true)

# Instanciating a `Plan` could look like this:

Plan.new(
  days: %i[sun sat],                              # Week-ends only
  hours: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], # Evenings only
  frequency: Frequency.new(                       # 4-hours per week
    amount_of_hours: 4,
    periodicity: :weekly,

    Location.new(
      scope: :type,
      reference: "small",
    ),
  ],
)

# After that, an algorithm could tell if the plan can be used for a
# `Reservation`. A reservation can be summarized by a studio for period of time.
# To tell if a candidate plan could apply, the `Resevation#can_use_plan?` method
# will also need, a reservation `history` and a candidate `plan` to test
# against.
